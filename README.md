React.js was utilized for this project due to it high performance when it come's to building responsive website and
web based applications.
CSS was used to styled the app using the Block Element Method (BEM) approach because it helps developers better understand the relationship between the HTML and CSS  in a given project as well as it help developers write clean, well organized and maintainable CSS and speeds up the development process.
For the icons, the react-icon library icons were used as they have a low build size.
